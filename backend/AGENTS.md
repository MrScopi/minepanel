# AGENTS.md - Backend

## Project Purpose

Minepanel backend is a NestJS API that manages Minecraft server lifecycle and runtime operations through Docker.

- Creates and updates per-server `docker-compose.yml` files.
- Starts, stops, and inspects containers.
- Handles auth, file management, worlds, proxy config, monitoring, and integrations.
- Supports Java and Bedrock with strategy-based behavior.

## Architecture

|- curseforge/              CurseForge search + per-mod version/changelog lookups (per-user API key)
|- bedrock-addons/          Bedrock behavior/resource pack management (search, import, enable/disable, reorder, sync to world)
|- system-monitoring/       Host metrics
|- metrics/                 Per-server CPU/RAM history (1-min sampler, query API)
|- alerts/                  Per-server Discord alerts (down / high CPU / high RAM), fed by the metrics sampler
|- scheduled-tasks/         Auto-restart and scheduled commands (fixed interval or cron expression via cron-parser)
|- users/                   User and settings persistence
|- settings/                Global (instance-wide) integration settings: SMTP/OIDC in DB
|- common/crypto/           Secret encryption at rest (AES-GCM, key derived from JWT_SECRET)
|- database/                TypeORM/sql.js setup
```

Integration settings & secrets:

- SMTP and OIDC are read via `InstanceSettingsService` (module `settings/`), which merges
  DB values over `.env` (DB wins). `auth-mail.service.ts` and `oidc.service.ts` consume it and
  re-read on change via `registerResetHandler`; do not read `config.get('smtp'|'oidc')` directly.
- Secrets (SMTP pass, OIDC client secret, CurseForge API key) are stored **encrypted** using
  `common/crypto/secret-cipher.ts` and are **write-only** over HTTP: responses expose booleans
  (`hasPassword`, `hasCfApiKey`, ...), never the value. The CurseForge key is decrypted only
  server-side (`SettingsService.getCfApiKey`) and injected into the generated compose plaintext
  so itzg reads it. Admin-only endpoints live in `users/controllers/integration-settings.controller.ts`.

Primary runtime relationship:

- API reads/writes local paths under `/app/servers` inside the backend container.
- Docker mounts host `${BASE_DIR}/servers` into backend `/app/servers`.
- Generated server compose files must use host absolute paths (`${BASE_DIR}/...`) for volume mounts.

## Key Commands

```bash
npm run start:dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

From repo root:

```bash
npm run start:dev --prefix backend
npm run test --prefix backend
```

## Code Patterns

- Keep controllers thin; put behavior in services.
- Validate DTOs with `class-validator` and reject invalid shape early.
- Use Nest exceptions and `Logger`; do not return ad-hoc error objects.
- Keep naming consistent: files `kebab-case`, classes `PascalCase`, methods `camelCase`.
- Keep changes surgical: no unrelated refactors, imports, or formatting churn.

Path and filesystem patterns (critical):

- `serversDir` is container-side path (`/app/servers`) from `backend/src/config.ts`.
- `baseDir` is host-side path used in generated compose mounts. It is auto-detected at startup
  from the host `Source` of the `/app/servers` bind (via `docker inspect` on the own container,
  see `detectHostBaseDir` in `config.ts`); `BASE_DIR` env is only a fallback (local dev / no
  Docker). A mismatch between env and detected path is logged.
- Never mix `serversDir` and `baseDir`; they are not interchangeable.
- Per-server canonical layout is:
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/docker-compose.yml`
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/mc-data/`
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/worlds/`
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/modpacks/` (mounted read-only at `/modpacks`; `CF_MODPACK_ZIP` and local `.mrpack` paths point here)
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/mod-library/` (`registry.json` + `downloads/`; manually tracked mods staged here before being applied into `mc-data/mods/`)
  - `/app/servers/<serverId>/backups/` (if backup enabled, default location)
- Backup host mount is configurable: `BACKUP_BASE_DIR` (`backupBaseDir`) sets a global host base, and per-server `backupHostDir` overrides it. When set, the backup mount's host side can point outside `${BASE_DIR}` (e.g. a NAS); the backend's `fs.ensureDir` for it is best-effort (Docker creates the bind source if unreachable). See `resolveBackupsHostPath`/`parseBackupHostDir` in `docker-compose.service.ts`.
- Global world library is reserved under `/app/servers/.world/worlds/`.
- Reserved/hidden folders must not be treated as server IDs.

## Critical Files

- `src/config.ts` - source of `serversDir` and `baseDir` behavior.
- `src/main.ts` - CORS/cookies/bootstrap behavior.
- `src/server-management/server-management.service.ts` - lifecycle, status, command execution, world selection.
- `src/server-management/strategies/server-strategy.factory.ts` - Java/Bedrock strategy selection.
- `src/docker-compose/docker-compose.service.ts` - compose generation, path-to-volume mapping, server discovery.
- `src/files/files.service.ts` - path validation and file API boundaries.
- `src/files/files.controller.ts` - upload/download API behavior.
- `src/mod-library/mod-library.service.ts` - manually tracked mods: registry.json persistence (same on-disk-JSON precedent as `bedrock-addons`, not the database), version/update checks, stage/apply lifecycle.
- `src/world-discovery/world-discovery.service.ts` - `.world` library import path.
- `src/proxy/proxy.service.ts` - proxy routes file path behavior.
- `src/server-management/auto-scale.controller.ts` - mc-router auto-scaling webhook.
- `package.json` - backend scripts.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

General:

- Read root `AGENTS.md` before backend edits.
- Do not add dependencies/scripts unless required by the task.
- If API contract changes, update frontend usage and docs in `doc/`.
- Backend auth is private-by-default through a global JWT guard; only explicitly `@Public()` routes should bypass auth.
- Keep auth transport limited to `httpOnly` cookies and bearer headers; never add JWT support via query params.
- `POST /servers/autoscale` (`src/server-management/auto-scale.controller.ts`) is the only `@Public()` route that controls servers. It is off unless `MC_PROXY_AUTOSCALE_TOKEN` is set, authenticates mc-router with a constant-time bearer comparison, and must keep accepting only servers present in `routes.json`.
- Optional SSO is OpenID Connect via `auth/oidc/*` (provider-agnostic; configured by `OIDC_*` env in `config.ts`). It validates the IdP `id_token` then issues the same Minepanel session cookies via `auth/utils/auth-cookies.ts`; the `client_secret` stays server-side and is never exposed. `OIDC_DISABLE_PASSWORD_LOGIN=true` blocks password login server-side (only when SSO is fully configured).

Server ID and directory safety:

- Keep server ID regex constraints (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`) for server lifecycle endpoints.
- Do not treat `.world` as a regular server.
- Do not assume every folder in `servers/` is a server; valid server requires expected structure (especially compose file).

Path model and volume mapping:

- Keep this distinction explicit in code changes:
  - Container path for backend IO: `/app/servers/...`
  - Host path for compose mount lines: `${BASE_DIR}/servers/...`
- In compose generation, `./` volume entries are expanded to host absolute paths under `${BASE_DIR}/servers/<serverId>/...`.
- Java world library mounts must remain read-only (`:ro`) when mapped to `/data/.world-library/local` and `/data/.world-library/global`.

Files module behavior:

- `serverId="_root"` maps to `/app/servers` in files API.
- `serverId=".world"` maps to `/app/servers/.world/worlds` in files API.
- Other server IDs map to `/app/servers/<serverId>/mc-data`.
- Preserve traversal protection (`normalize` + `startsWith(basePath)`).

Data migration and compatibility:

- Keep misplaced data migration logic (`server root -> mc-data`) intact when touching server creation.
- Preserve Java/Bedrock compatibility in lifecycle and command execution paths.
- Bedrock permission fix depends on host path mount and UID/GID from compose; do not break this flow.

## Required AGENTS.md Content

Every backend AGENTS update must include:

- Project purpose
- Architecture
- Key commands
- Code patterns
- Critical files
- Specific agent instructions
- Context Maintenance Rule

## Writing Tips (Mandatory)

- Be specific: prefer file paths and concrete rules over generic advice.
- Reference key files directly for high-risk areas (paths, compose, files API).
- Keep only high-signal context; remove noise.
- Add or tighten rules when recurring mistakes appear.

## Context Maintenance (Golden Rule)

The agent must keep `backend/AGENTS.md` and `backend/README.md` updated whenever backend workflow, architecture, commands, or conventions change.
